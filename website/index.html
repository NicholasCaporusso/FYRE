			<h2>Why join</h2>
			<p class="lead" style="font-weight:normal">FYRE enables students to see first hand the research and creative activity conducted at NKU and see how it can translate into their own experiences and career paths.</p>
			<h4>1. Research is awesome!</h4>
			<p class="lead" style="font-weight:normal">Although research can be intimidating at first, students refer to it as one of the most rewarding experiences of their academic journeys. The FYRE program is designed to make research more accessible and inclusive thanks to faculty mentors who guide students in every step.</p>
			<h4>2. Career readiness</h4>
			<p class="lead" style="font-weight:normal">Research and creative activities enhance students' career readiness, communication skills, critical thinking, leadership, professionalism, and teamwork. Moreover, getting involved in research and creative projects helps develop traits and experiences that are relevant for employers.</p>
			<h4>3. Academic success</h4>
			<p class="lead" style="font-weight:normal">Students involved in research are more likely to discover and pursue their talents and passions earlier and more successfully. This is why we believe FYRE can make the difference for every student.</p>
			<h2>How it works</h2>
			<p class="lead">The FYRE program has a duration of two semesters and is structured into two courses that students can take for credit.</p>
